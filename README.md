# Onesti_Raines_Tran_GOV50
Gov 50 2020 final project by Charles Onesti, Cole Raines, and Thuan Tran.  We investigate the Harvard Public Opinions Poll to measure the effect of years of education on what people believe is the biggest problem in society. In particular, we hypothesize that more years of education leads to a greater likelihood that a person believes climate change is the most important issue facing society.
