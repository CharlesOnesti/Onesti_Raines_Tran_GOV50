Data explanation here:
What is your dataset?
We are using the Harvard Public Opinions Poll dataset.
+ what is the size of your dataset?
Our sample has 3022 units and 196 variables.  In our study, we only look at information from 6 of these variables.
+ What is the unit of analysis?
+ What is your research design (cross sectional, randomized experiment, etc)
- What is your dependent variable and how is it coded? If you cleaned your data in some way, how did you do it? (i.e. recoded data from percent to decimal, dropped some irrelevant responses, etc.)
```{r, echo = FALSE}

- Are you considering any confounders? How are they coded?
We are looking into income category and home urbanization as possible confounding variables. In the dataset there is detailed income bracket data which we have categorized into three buckets from lower, middle, and upper to observe the main trends
# Results
Your results paragraphs should answer the following questions:
- What is the observed relationship when you plot it?

Data explanation here:
What is your dataset?
We are using the Harvard Public Opinions Poll dataset.
+ what is the size of your dataset?
Our sample has 3022 units and 196 variables.  In our study, we only look at information from 6 of these variables.
+ What is the unit of analysis?
+ What is your research design (cross sectional, randomized experiment, etc)
- What is your dependent variable and how is it coded? If you cleaned your data in some way, how did you do it? (i.e. recoded data from percent to decimal, dropped some irrelevant responses, etc.)
